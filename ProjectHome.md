### AI Chat Bot implemented in Haskell ###
The bot uses open source AIML files of [A.L.I.C.E.](http://www.alicebot.org) project as the knowledge database.
Two interfaces have been provided
  1. Terminal Based Chat
  1. Web-based using Haskell CGI. The `BotWeb.hs` can be compiled to a cgi script. Which may be called from a webpage to chat with the bot.
